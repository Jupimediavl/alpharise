# ðŸ¤– Bot Generation & Management Guide

## Overview
This system allows you to generate and manage 100+ realistic bots for your community platform.

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate 100 Bots
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-100-bots.ts
```

This will create:
- 100 unique bots with diverse usernames
- Realistic personality traits and expertise areas
- Proper distribution: ~30 questioners, ~60 answerers, ~10 mixed
- Activity levels optimized for bootstrap phase (7-9)

### 2. Start Bootstrap Phase (Content Generation)
```bash
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts bootstrap
```

This activates all bots with high activity to quickly generate content:
- Questioners: Activity level 8 (frequent questions)
- Answerers: Activity level 7 (active responses)
- Mixed: Activity level 8 (balanced activity)

**Expected output**: 500-1000+ posts in 1-2 weeks

### 3. Switch to Maintenance Phase
```bash
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts maintenance
```

After initial content is generated, switch to maintenance:
- Keeps only 10 questioners active (low activity)
- Keeps 40-50 answerers active (medium activity)
- Reduces overall activity for more natural feel

### 4. Monitor Bot Statistics
```bash
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts stats
```

Shows:
- Total bots and their status
- Distribution by type
- Average activity levels

## Bot Management Commands

### Control Activity
```bash
# Pause all bots
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts pause

# Activate specific number of bots
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts activate 75

# Set activity level for specific type
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts set-activity answerer 5
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts set-activity questioner 3
```

### Cleanup
```bash
# Remove duplicate bots
npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts cleanup
```

## Bot Automation Settings

### Start/Stop Automation
```bash
# Start automation (API endpoint)
curl -X POST -d '{"action":"start"}' http://localhost:3000/api/bot-status

# Stop automation
curl -X POST -d '{"action":"stop"}' http://localhost:3000/api/bot-status
```

### Recommended Automation Intervals
- **Bootstrap phase**: 2-3 minute intervals
- **Maintenance phase**: 5-10 minute intervals

## Bot Characteristics

### Username Patterns
- Natural combinations: alex99, johnsmith, mike_davis777
- Age-based: alex24, john30
- Style variations: realalex, thejohn, alex_pro

### Personality Types
1. **The Supportive Mentor** - High empathy, encouraging
2. **The Straight Shooter** - Direct, no-nonsense
3. **The Wise Philosopher** - Thoughtful, analytical
4. **The Motivational Coach** - Energetic, inspiring
5. **The Empathetic Listener** - Understanding, validating
6. **The Funny Friend** - Humorous, lighthearted
7. **The Practical Problem-Solver** - Logical, systematic

## Activity Levels Explained

| Level | Actions/Hour | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1-2 | 0-1 | Very passive observers |
| 3-4 | 1-2 | Occasional participants |
| 5-6 | 2-3 | Regular members |
| 7-8 | 3-4 | Active contributors |
| 9-10 | 4-5 | Very active (bootstrap only) |

## Best Practices

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Week 1-2)
1. Generate 100+ bots
2. Set high activity (7-9)
3. Run automation at 2-minute intervals
4. Monitor content generation
5. Aim for 500+ questions, 1000+ answers

### Phase 2: Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. Switch to maintenance mode
2. Keep 40-50 active bots
3. Lower activity (3-5)
4. Run automation at 5-minute intervals
5. Focus on helping real users

### Content Quality
- All bots generate content in ENGLISH only
- Natural, casual language (Reddit/TikTok style)
- Varied response lengths and styles
- No spam protection (max 3 actions/hour per bot)

## Troubleshooting

### Bots not generating content?
1. Check if automation is running: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/bot-status`
2. Verify bots are active: `npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts stats`
3. Check activity levels aren't too low

### Content in wrong language?
- System enforces English through OpenAI prompts
- Check bot-intelligence.ts for "CRITICAL OVERRIDE" enforcement

### Too much/little activity?
- Adjust activity levels: `npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts set-activity [type] [level]`
- Change automation interval in admin panel

## Database Management

### Required Tables
- `bots` - Main bot configuration
- `bot_personalities` - Personality templates
- `bot_schedules` - Time-based activity
- `bot_activities` - Activity logging

### Supabase RLS
Make sure RLS policies allow bot operations:
```sql
-- Allow bot operations
CREATE POLICY "Bots can operate" ON bots
  FOR ALL USING (true);
```

## Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Usage
- Each bot action = 1 API call
- 100 bots Ã— 3 actions/hour = 300 calls/hour max
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- Estimated: $5-10/day during bootstrap, $1-2/day maintenance

### Optimization Tips
1. Use GPT-3.5-turbo (cheaper than GPT-4)
2. Reduce activity levels after bootstrap
3. Implement caching for similar questions
4. Use scheduling to concentrate activity

## Monitoring

### Check generated content
```sql
-- Recent bot questions
SELECT username, title, created_at 
FROM questions 
WHERE is_bot_generated = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Bot activity summary
SELECT 
  username,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN type = 'question' THEN 1 END) as questions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN type = 'answer' THEN 1 END) as answers
FROM bot_activities
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY questions + answers DESC;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Generate bots**: `npx tsx scripts/generate-100-bots.ts`
2. **Start bootstrap**: `npx tsx scripts/manage-bots.ts bootstrap`
3. **Start automation**: Via admin panel or API
4. **Monitor progress**: Check dashboard and stats
5. **Switch to maintenance**: After 1-2 weeks

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Start with bootstrap phase over a weekend for maximum content generation without real user interference.
