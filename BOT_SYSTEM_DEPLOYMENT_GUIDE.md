# AlphaRise Bot System - Deployment & Testing Guide

## üöÄ Comprehensive Bot Management System

This guide covers the deployment and testing of the new AI-powered bot system for AlphaRise Community.

## üìã System Overview

### What Was Built:
1. **Database Schema** - Complete bot management tables in Supabase
2. **Bot Management Functions** - CRUD operations and analytics
3. **OpenAI Integration** - Human-like question/answer generation
4. **Automation Engine** - Scheduled bot behaviors and interactions
5. **Admin Interface** - Complete UI for bot management
6. **Phantom Users Cleanup** - Removed old hardcoded bot system

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Database Schema
1. Open your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire content from `supabase_bot_system.sql`
3. Execute the SQL commands

This will create:
- `bots` table - Main bot configuration
- `bot_personalities` table - Personality templates
- `bot_activities` table - Activity logging
- `bot_schedules` table - Time-based scheduling
- `bot_interactions` table - Bot-to-bot interactions
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies for security
- Default personality templates
- Triggers for automatic stats updates

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created
Run this query to verify all tables exist:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'bot%';
```

Expected tables:
- bots
- bot_personalities
- bot_activities
- bot_schedules
- bot_interactions

## üîß Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# or
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## üéÆ Admin Interface Testing

### Access Bot Management
1. Navigate to `/admin` in your application
2. Click on "Bot Management" in the sidebar
3. You should see:
   - Bot analytics cards
   - Automation engine controls
   - Bot management table
   - Personality templates section

### Test Bot Creation
1. Click "Create Bot" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - Name: "Sarah Helper"
   - Username: "sarah_helper"
   - Type: "Mixed"
   - Activity Level: 7
   - Bio: "I help people with confidence building"
   - Expertise: "confidence building, social anxiety"
   - Model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
   - Status: "Active"
3. Save and verify the bot appears in the table

### Test Manual Bot Actions
1. Click the "üëÅÔ∏è" (eye) icon on a bot to view details
2. In the modal, test manual triggers:
   - "Trigger Question" - Bot should post a question to community
   - "Trigger Answer" - Bot should answer an existing question
   - "Trigger Vote" - Bot should vote on an answer

### Test Automation Engine
1. Click "Start Automation" button
2. Status should change to "Running"
3. Monitor console logs for automation cycles
4. Verify bots post content automatically every 5 minutes

## ü§ñ Bot System Features

### Bot Types:
- **Questioner**: Primarily asks questions
- **Answerer**: Primarily provides answers
- **Mixed**: Both questions and answers

### Activity Levels (1-10):
- Higher level = more frequent activity
- Lower level = more realistic, sparse activity

### OpenAI Integration:
- Uses personality templates for consistent behavior
- Generates human-like questions and answers
- Contextually aware responses
- Anti-spam measures built-in

### Automation Features:
- Configurable time intervals (default: 5 minutes)
- Activity level-based probability
- Anti-spam protections
- Bot-to-bot interaction prevention
- Schedule-based activity (future enhancement)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check rate limits and billing
   - Monitor console for specific error messages

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase connection
   - Check RLS policies allow operations
   - Ensure user has proper permissions

3. **Bots Not Posting**
   - Check automation engine is running
   - Verify bot status is "active"
   - Check activity level settings
   - Monitor console logs for errors

4. **Admin Interface Not Loading**
