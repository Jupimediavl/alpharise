### 1. **Database Setup**
Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add admin functionality to existing users table
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Create index for fast admin lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_is_admin ON users(is_admin);

-- Set your user as admin (replace with your email)
UPDATE users SET is_admin = TRUE WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';

COMMENT ON COLUMN users.is_admin IS 'TRUE if user has admin privileges for moderation and system management';
```

### 2. **How to Make a User Admin**
